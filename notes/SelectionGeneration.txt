Unlike 1.6, in 1.7 the client doesn't retrieve unloaded chunks automatically from the server.  If an unloaded chunk is
requested, it returns a blank chunk instead.

The complex tools generate the selection on the client side.  This means that, if the selection is bigger than the
range of loaded chunks on the client, part of the selection is missing.

Two proposed answers:
1) Keep selection algorithm on the client.  Request missing data from server as required (send all blockID and metadata); compress
or
2) Run selection algorithm on the client.   Missing chunks are marked and sent to server.  Server completes the selection
 algorithm and sends back the blockID and metadata for the "shell" only (blocks fully enclosed don't need to provide ID/meta because they won't be rendered.)
 compressed.

For example of 256x256x256
1) is simpler but requires much more packets (up to say 33 MB for the entire transmission)
2) is more complicated but needs far fewer packets.

Plan:
Simplify even further-
a) Run selection algorithm on the client.  If there are no missing chunks, send it to the server as usual.
b) If there are one or more missing chunks;
  1) show them in the selection as fuzzy blocks
  2) tell the server to run the selection algorithm
  3) server transmits selection back to the client.  client updates the render; foggy faces instead of block textures where the block isn't known.

The command to the server to generate a selection is a new packet type handled by the ServerVoxelSelection

The detailed protocol is:
(1) Client sends a Command with uniqueID to the server
(2) Server replies with a STATUS and the uniqueID
(3) Client occasionally sends STATUS_REQUEST to get status updates
(4) When the server generation is complete, it starts transmission to the client through a MultipartOneAtATimeSender
(5) When the transmission is finished, the client updates its rendered view of the selection then displays it.
