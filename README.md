SpeedyTools
===========

A set of custom items for Minecraft(Forge) to help you build faster.

Currently in progress.

Planned:
- create or destroy a defined-length row of blocks with one click
- place a "layer" of new blocks on top of an existing layer with one click
- destroy the top layer you click on
- flood fill 
- place a block in mid air (immediately in front of you)
